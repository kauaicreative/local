I lived in Europe for 7 years, and the pizzas are close to true Italian style and the mussels are a close competitor to true Belgian varietals. Dogs are welcome on the patio and live music is often performed on many weekends. The wait times can be a bit longer, but the staff uses a cell-phone text system and allows a 15 minute window which provides ample time to visit the Mast store around the corner. There’s also a free EV charger across the street which is frequently available.",
